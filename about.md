In 2011, as a Field Organizer for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus I was lucky enough to be at a training put on by the Analyst Institute. It was my second cycle as an FO, and that training opened my eyes to the power that data had in winning political campaigns. I was lucky that my Field Director encouraged a data-driven field program; an ethos I've taken with me through several more cycles of electoral organizing, as well as to both labor and community organizing positions.

I've been lucky that every campaign I've worked on since then had someone who understood the value of data in a decision making position (the fact that it was me frequently notwithstanding). Not every campaign or movement has that same luxury. There is still plenty of low-hanging fruit in data insights within the progressive space. My goal is to help find ways to use them to win.

And the analysis that helps target political communications is pretty useful when deciding where to focus while playing some modern board games as well.
