In Vermont, about 60% of registered voters live in multimember state house districts, which are represented by 2 state representatives. These 2 members of the state house are elected at the same time and serve concurrent terms, representing the voters of their district. The remaining voters have only a single representative. Regardless of whether the representative represents a single or two member district, they serve a 2 year term. This difference has a serious difference in the representation of those voters. <!--more-->

(The 30 State Senators range from those who represent a Senate District by themselves, all the way up to the Chittenden Senate District, which elects 6 Senators, a full 20% of the body.)

Here, I'll concern myself only with the State House, and leave the Senate aside.

In 2016, 16 Single Member District races took place between a Democratic nominee facing off against a Republican nominee with no other candidates in the race. In these races the average undervoting rate was 4%, that is, for every 100 voters who cast a  ballot in these districts, 4 people did not cast a vote in the State House race.

During the same 2016 election, 13 multimember districts elected 26 Represenatives in races that featured exactly 2 Democratic candidates and 2 Republican candidates. For these races the undervoting rate was nearly 4 times higher, at 15.8% of the available votes not being cast.

This has a few possible explanations. It could be that 4 times as many people choose not to vote at all in their State House elections in multimember districts. Or perhaps, although, each voter had 2 votes to cast in the rase, in addition to the 4% base rate, an additional 23.6% (11.8 * 2) of voters cast only a single vote. More likely it was some combination of these factors.

Ultimately, up to 28% of voters in multimember districts who would have voted for their State Representative had they been registered in a single member district are not casting all of their votes. This is in addition to the 4% of voters who had rolled off by the time they got to State House races. In comparison, uncontested house races see an increase in undervotes of 9.9 percentage points.

When expanding the analysis to all house districts with a contested race, regardless of the party affiliations of the candidates on the ballot, the increase in undervoting from single member house districts to multimember house districts is 14.2 percentage points, compared to the 11.8 percentage point increase in races with a full slate of Democrats and Republicans and no other candidates.

Looking at 2016 races, given a district with a contested race for State House, if that district is a single member or multimember district explains 73.4% of the variance in undervoting, and when limited to only districts that feature a full slate of Democrats and a full slate of Republicans and no other candidates that number increases to 88.8%.

Assuming that in reality there is no difference in undervoting for multimember districts, there is just about a 1 in 40,000,000,000,000 chance that we'd see a difference as extreme as we do in the 2016 results.
